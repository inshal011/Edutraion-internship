    #  Advanced Customer Churn Predictor

    This app predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their profile.  
    The model was trained on real customer behavior and demographic data.

    ### ðŸ›  How to Use
    - Fill in the customer details below.
    - **1 = Yes, 0 = No** for "Has Credit Card" and "Is Active Member".
    - Choose the customer's country and gender using the dropdowns.
    - Click **Submit** to see the prediction and an explanation.
