🎬 Task 1: Movie Genre Classifier using Gradio
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that classifies movie genres based on their plot descriptions. The goal is to automate the genre tagging process for platforms like streaming services, production houses, or content databases.

🔍 Key Highlights:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned text data by removing punctuation, stopwords, and applying lemmatization to improve model accuracy.

Feature Engineering: Converted textual descriptions into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.

Modeling: Trained and tested multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes), selecting the best based on precision and F1-score.

Evaluation: Evaluated model using a confusion matrix and classification metrics to analyze genre prediction performance.

Deployment: Integrated the model into a Gradio interface, allowing users to input any movie plot and get instant genre prediction.

🚀 Real-World Use Case:
This tool simulates how production teams or streaming services might use AI to auto-tag content based on plot summaries—speeding up categorization and improving content discovery.
