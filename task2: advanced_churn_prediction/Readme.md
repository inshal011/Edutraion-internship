ðŸ“Š Task 2: Advanced Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on building an end-to-end customer churn prediction system for a subscription-based business using machine learning. Unlike basic churn models, this project includes extensive data analysis, advanced modeling, and real-time prediction deployment.

âœ… Key Features:
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, performed feature scaling with StandardScaler, and encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding.

Removed redundant columns to reduce noise and improve model efficiency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized key churn patterns related to age, activity status, geography, credit score, and balance.

Used boxplots, heatmaps, and count plots to identify strong indicators of churn.

Model Building:

Trained both Logistic Regression (as a baseline model) and Random Forest Classifier for higher accuracy.

Compared performance using classification reports and accuracy scores.

Gradio Interface Deployment:

Built a clean Gradio web interface to allow real-time churn prediction by entering customer data.

Generates interpretable textual explanations based on user input.

Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces:

Hosted the full app on Hugging Face for free public access.

Allows anyone to interact with the model without writing a single line of code.

ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Use Case:
Churn prediction is crucial for customer retention strategies. This tool helps businesses identify at-risk customers early so they can take proactive steps to retain them.
